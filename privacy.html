  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Speed-Proof is a mobile application designed to help users monitor their speed, route, and environmental conditions during various activities?including walking, jogging, running, cycling, bike riding, and boating.

  <p>We may collect non-personal device data such as model type, operating system version, app version, and network status to improve app performance.</p>

  <h2>4. Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    Speed-Proof uses smartphone GPS and third-party weather services to estimate speed, location, and environmental conditions. While the app may closely match your vehicle?s speedometer or activity pace under normal conditions, it does not guarantee 100% accuracy in speed tracking or weather data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speed-Proof is designed for personal awareness and activity improvement?not for legal defense. It is not certified or intended for use as legal evidence in traffic disputes, insurance claims, or court proceedings.
  </p>
  <p>
    GPS signals can be affected by terrain, signal interference, device settings, and environmental factors. All data generated by Speed-Proof should be treated as informational, not definitive or legally binding.
