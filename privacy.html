  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Speed-Proof is a mobile application designed to help users monitor their speed, route, and environmental conditions during various activities including walking, jogging, running, cycling, bike riding, boating, and hiking. 
    The app includes features such as real-time speed tracking, route documentation, and compass-based navigation to support both urban and off-road use. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the limitations of the apps accuracy and intended use.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What We Collect</h2>
  <h3>a. Location Data</h3>
  <p>We collect GPS-based location data to calculate speed, route history, compass direction, and timestamps. This data is only gathered during active tracking sessions and is stored locally on your device.</p>

  <h3>b. Weather Data</h3>
  <p>Speed-Proof integrates weather information from third-party APIs based on your location. This includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.</p>

  <h3>c. Device Information</h3>
  <p>We may collect non-personal device data such as model type, operating system version, app version, and network status to improve app performance.</p>

  <h3>d. Usage Data</h3>
  <p>Anonymous usage metrics such as session duration, feature interactions (including compass navigation and waypoint marking), and crash reports may be collected to help us improve the app experience.</p>

  <h2>4. Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    Speed-Proof uses smartphone GPS, compass sensors, and third-party weather services to estimate speed, location, direction, and environmental conditions. While the app may closely match your vehicles speedometer or hiking pace under normal conditions, it does not guarantee 100% accuracy in tracking or weather data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speed-Proof is designed for personal awareness and activity improvement. It is not certified or intended for use in formal disputes, insurance claims, or official documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    GPS and compass signals can be affected by terrain, signal interference, device settings, and environmental factors. All data generated by Speed-Proof should be treated as informational, not definitive.
